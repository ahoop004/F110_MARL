# F110_MARL

Multi-agent reinforcement learning stack for F1TENTH-style racing. The project wraps a high-fidelity simulator, PettingZoo-compatible environment, and a roster of training agents so you can stage adversarial racing scenarios (e.g., attacker vs. defender) and iterate on policies with PPO, TD3, DQN, or classic heuristics.
